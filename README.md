# Notes Export

Simple scripts to quickly read notes and export them to .html files. The javascript file lets you select n number of notes to be exported. The applescript selects all notes at once.

To use the scripts make sure there are no unicode titles as `:` ans `/` will not be read properly.

To use the applescript, change `rootPath` to your preferred root.

Some attached screenshots for the JS App being run are.
