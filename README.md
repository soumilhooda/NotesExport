# Notes Export

Simple scripts to quickly read notes and export them to .html files. Made as I love writing in my notes app. It gives me the ability to change devices and continue work at ease. Also, I like pushing my writings as blogs.

The javascript file lets you select n number of notes to be exported. The applescript selects all notes at once.

# Usage 

To use the scripts make sure there are no unicode titles as `:` and `/` will not be read properly.

To use the applescript, change `rootPath` to your preferred root.

# Visuals

Some attached screenshots for the JS App being run are.
